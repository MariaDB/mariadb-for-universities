# MariaDB for Universities training material 

This repo contains training material for MariaDB DBA and Developer courses. Released for non-commercial use by MariaDB Corporation with license [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

# Beta version of site

The DBA and Developer courses are "beta live" in their HTML renderings at https://uni.mariadb.org/dba/ and https://uni.mariadb.org/dev/. The beta site makes it possible to browse the material in a more readable format with overviews. The right menu has links to edit the source markdown files in Github.

Approved changes to the markdown files in this main repo will trigger a copy of the markdown files to the deploy branch with the Hugo site (see [Github actions](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-for-universities/actions)). An update of the deploy branch will in turn trigger an update of the beta site hosted on Netlify.
