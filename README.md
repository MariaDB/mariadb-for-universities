# MariaDB for Universities training material

# Beta version of site

The DBA and Developer courses are “beta live” in their HTML renderings at https://mariadb4uni.netlify.app/dba/ and https://mariadb4uni.netlify.app/dev/. The beta site makes it possible to browse the material in a more readable format with overviews. The right menu has links to edit the source markdown files in Github.

Approved changes to the markdown files in this main repo will trigger a copy of the markdown files to the deploy branch with the Hugo site (see [Github Action](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-for-universities/actions/workflows/copy-dba-content.yml)). An update of the deploy branch will in turn trigger an update of the beta site hosted on Netlify.
