# Beta version of site

The DBA course is “beta live” in their HTML rendering at: https://mariadb4uni.netlify.app/dba/

Changes to the markdown files in this main repo will trigger a copy of the markdown files to the deploy branch with the Hugo site (see [Github Action](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-for-universities/actions/workflows/copy-dba-content.yml)). An update of the deploy branch will in turn trigger an update of the beta site hosted on Netlify.
